:christmas_tree: Currently [doing](https://github.com/spamegg1/advent-of-code-2023-scala) [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) [in Scala](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/2023/), join me!

:computer: I contributed a lot to [Futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io) and [OSSU CS](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/), so check them out!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: math or code questions!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: `spamegg1` on Discord, or [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/spamegg/shared_invite/zt-1vhzofzrl-ucBjeQEQkl9Ol3wpvL9VPw), or [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!GQFJgtvxFByBVixTAi:matrix.org?via=matrix.org)

âš¡ Fun fact: I [review](https://github.com/spamegg1/reviews) online courses.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: my own Math + CS curriculum.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: lots of Scala libraries, especially [Doodle](https://github.com/creativescala/doodle) and [Scala Native](https://scala-native.org/en/stable/).

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for: suggestions with interesting and creative ideas to teach logic gates, ALU / CPU, assembly; something simpler than [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

:desktop_computer: I use ![Mint](mint.svg)
