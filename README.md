### Hi there 👋

> ***It soon became clear that the unconscious instincts for logic and language which had enabled me to succeed were not shared by the large majority of my students.*** - Susanna Epp (author of [Discrete Mathematics with Applications, 5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp-ebook/dp/B07M87BWRC))

:computer: I contributed a lot to [Futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io) and [OSSU CS](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/), so check them out!

💬 Ask me about: math or code questions!

📫 How to reach me: `spamegg1` on Discord, or [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/spamegg/shared_invite/zt-1vhzofzrl-ucBjeQEQkl9Ol3wpvL9VPw), or [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!GQFJgtvxFByBVixTAi:matrix.org?via=matrix.org)

⚡ Fun fact: I [review](https://github.com/spamegg1/reviews) online courses.

🔭 I’m currently working on: my own Math + CS curriculum.

🌱 I’m currently learning: lots of Scala libraries, especially [Doodle](https://github.com/creativescala/doodle) and [Scala Native](https://scala-native.org/en/stable/).

🤔 I’m looking for: suggestions with interesting and creative ideas to teach logic gates, ALU / CPU, assembly; something simpler than [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
