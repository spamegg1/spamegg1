:computer: I contributed a lot to [Futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io) and [OSSU CS](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/), so check them out!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: math or code questions!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: `spamegg#3510` on Discord.

âš¡ Fun fact: I [review](https://github.com/spamegg1/reviews) online courses.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: my own Math + CS curriculum.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: lots of Scala libraries, especially [Doodle](https://github.com/creativescala/doodle) and [Scala Native](https://scala-native.org/en/stable/).

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for: suggestions with interesting and creative ideas to teach logic gates, ALU / CPU, assembly; something simpler than [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
